Hi there, please see the two included PSDs for a reference on the designs.

Your task will be to get the designs from these PSD and convert them into 
HTML and CSS, there is no requirement to do any javascript interactions 
(not even on mobile), also there is no need to worry about having the exact 
font, you can use any sans-serif font.

Please use bootstrap or similar css framework.
Bootstrap is preferred but not required, if you decide to use a diferent
framework please include a reference for the documentation files.

The page has to be responsive and the css must be using mobile first approach.

Usage of a preprocessor like SASS or LESS is not a requirement, but it is preferred.

Please send back an archive with your files, without the PSD source.

Good Luck!
